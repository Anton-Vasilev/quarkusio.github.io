                It is our pleasure to announce the release of Quarkus 3.3.0. The first thing you will notice in this release is that we dropped the .Final suffix. This suffix was introduced to make sure final releases were sorted properly compared to alphas, beta and candidate releases, at a time where...

                As mentioned in previous blog posts, we encourage all our users to upgrade to Quarkus 3 (it is an easy task with quarkus update). However we understand the migration can require some time so we will continue to maintain 2.16.x for a while. Today, we released Quarkus 2.16.9.Final, the ninth...

                During the development of Quarkus 2.13, we discovered that there was a startup degradation in native mode. One of the key aspects of this degradation was that RSS consumption on start up had gone up by about 10-15% compared to Quarkus 2.7. In this blog post you will learn how...

                Today, we released Quarkus 3.2.2.Final, the second maintenance release of our 3.2 release train. We released 3.2.1.Final a few days ago but two annoying regressions were spotted before we announced it so we decided to not announce it and release a 3.2.2.Final right away. These two releases contains mostly bugfixes...

            <description>
                Quarkus native executables offer many benefits such as even faster start-up time and low footprint. However, one major drawback is that such native binaries can be less observable. The good news is that you can still use JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) when running your Quarkus applications as native executables. Native...

                Ever since the very first days of Quarkus, the days that are now covered by the blissful fog of oblivion and the survivors only talk about them after a few pints of beer, dependency injection container was an integral part of the envisioned framework. And not just any dependency injection...
