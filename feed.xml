                August is upon us but we are still steadily publishing new Quarkus releases. Today, we released Quarkus 3.2.3.Final, the third maintenance release of our 3.2 release train. It should be a safe upgrade for anyone already using 3.2. Note that this version upgrades Hibernate Search to 6.2 as we wanted...

                As mentioned in previous blog posts, we encourage all our users to upgrade to Quarkus 3 (it is an easy task with quarkus update). However we understand the migration can require some time so we will continue to maintain 2.16.x for a while. Today, we released Quarkus 2.16.9.Final, the ninth...

            <description>
                During the development of Quarkus 2.13, we discovered that there was a startup degradation in native mode. One of the key aspects of this degradation was that RSS consumption on start up had gone up by about 10-15% compared to Quarkus 2.7. In this blog post you will learn how...

                Today, we released Quarkus 3.2.2.Final, the second maintenance release of our 3.2 release train. We released 3.2.1.Final a few days ago but two annoying regressions were spotted before we announced it so we decided to not announce it and release a 3.2.2.Final right away. These two releases contains mostly bugfixes...

            <description>
                Quarkus native executables offer many benefits such as even faster start-up time and low footprint. However, one major drawback is that such native binaries can be less observable. The good news is that you can still use JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) when running your Quarkus applications as native executables. Native...

                Ever since the very first days of Quarkus, the days that are now covered by the blissful fog of oblivion and the survivors only talk about them after a few pints of beer, dependency injection container was an integral part of the envisioned framework. And not just any dependency injection...

            <description>
                The Quarkus component model is built on top of CDI. However, writing unit tests for beans without a running CDI container is often a tedious work. Without the container services up and running, all the work has to be done manually. First of all, no dependency injection is performed. Furthermore,...
