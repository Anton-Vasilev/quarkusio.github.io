Quarkus native applications offer many benefits such as even faster start-up time and low footprint. However, one major drawback is that such native binaries can be less observable. The good news is that you can still use JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) when running your Quarkus applications in native mode.  Native mode JFR is still limited compared to regular JFR in Java mode. However, major improvements have been made over the past couple years that make it a very powerful tool to profile and monitor your native executables. Check out these recent articles to find out more about how you can start using JFR in native mode: https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/06/13/how-monitor-quarkus-native-executables-jfr[How to monitor Quarkus native executables with JFR] and https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/06/13/improvements-native-image-jfr-support-graalvm-jdk-20[Improvements to Native Image JFR support in GraalVM for JDK 20]
