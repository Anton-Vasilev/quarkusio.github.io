The Funqy HTTP + Azure Functions binding is not a replacement for REST over HTTP.  Because Funqy
needs to be portable cross a lot of different protocols and function providers its HTTP binding
is very minimalistic and you will lose REST features like linking and the ability to leverage
HTTP features like cache-control and conditional GETs.  You may want to consider using Quarkus&#8217;s
Jakarta REST, Spring MVC, or Vert.x Web Reactive Route <a href="azure-functions-http">support</a> instead.  They also work with Quarkus and Azure Functions.
