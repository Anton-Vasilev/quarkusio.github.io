<p>Quarkus supports continuous testing, where tests run immediately after code changes have been saved. This allows you to
get instant feedback on your code changes. Quarkus detects which tests cover which code, and uses this information to
only run the relevant tests when code is changed.</p>

<h2 id="controlling-continuous-testing"><a class="anchor" href="#controlling-continuous-testing"></a>4. Controlling Continuous Testing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are various hotkeys you can use to control continuous testing. Pressing <code>h</code> will display the following list
of commands:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-none hljs">The following commands are available:
[r] - Re-run all tests
[f] - Re-run failed tests
[b] - Toggle 'broken only' mode, where only failing tests are run (disabled)
[v] - Print failures from the last test run
[p] - Pause tests
[o] - Toggle test output (disabled)
[i] - Toggle instrumentation based reload (disabled)
[l] - Toggle live reload (enabled)
[s] - Force restart
[h] - Display this help
[q] - Quit</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are explained below:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">[r] - Re-run all tests</dt>
<dd>
<p>This will re-run every test</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">[f] - Re-run failed tests</dt>
<dd>
<p>This will re-run every failing test</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">[b] - Toggle 'broken only' mode, where only failing tests are run</dt>
<dd>
<p>Broken only mode will only run tests that have previously failed, even if other tests would normally be affected by a code
change. This can be useful if you are modifying code that is used by lots of tests, but you only want to focus on debugging
the failing one.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">[v] - Print failures from the last test run</dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints the failures to the console again, this can be useful if there has been lots of console output since the last run.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">[p] - Pause tests</dt>
<dd>
<p>Temporarily stops running tests. This can be useful if you are making lots of changes, and don&#8217;t want feedback until they
are all done.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">[o] - Toggle test output</dt>
<dd>
<p>By default test output is filtered and not displayed on the console, so that test output and dev mode output is not
interleaved. Enabling test output will print output to the console when tests are run. Even when output is disabled
the filtered output is saved and can be viewed in the Dev UI.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">[i] - Toggle instrumentation based reload</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is not directly related to testing, but allows you to toggle instrumentation based reload. This will allow live reload
to avoid a restart if a change does not affect the structure of a class, which gives a faster reload and allows you to keep
state.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">[l] - Toggle live reload</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is not directly related to testing, but allows you to turn live reload on and off.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">[s] - Force restart</dt>
<dd>
<p>This will force a scan for changed files, and will perform a live reload with and changes. Note that even if there are no
changes the application will still restart. This will still work even if live reload is disabled.</p>
</dd>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible to run continuous testing without starting dev mode. This can be useful if dev mode will interfere with
your tests (e.g. running wiremock on the same port), or if you only want to develop using tests. To start continuous testing
mode run <code>mvn quarkus:test</code>.</p>
